The program is a simple course registration system that demonstrates different Python data types and operations:

Integers: Manages student IDs â†’ removes invalid ones (<100) and sorts the list.

Strings: Creates a formatted registration report with conditions on student numbers.

Dictionaries: Stores courses and student counts â†’ updates, deletes, and calculates total/average.

Lists: Stores course names and allows adding new courses.

Booleans: Checks if the average registration is above a set threshold.

Arrays: Stores course counts in an array and computes total, average, min, and max.

ðŸ‘‰ Overall, it shows how to use basic Python structures (lists, dictionaries, arrays, strings, booleans) to simulate parts of a course registration system.
